In the first step we will create a corpus made from Shakespeare's texts and of other literature published around his time. From these and external ressources we will create a list of words and phrases. We want to track usages (spreading) of these during the following decades. We may have to pay close attention to the development of book printing.

Matt's comments: This looks very interesting. 

A few questions to think about: Where will you get your Shakespeare texts?

Sites for Textes:

archive.org
gutenberg project

How will you choose your words and phrases?

* Oxford Dictionary and Textes before the Shakespeare decade for generating the Corpus.
* Textes after the shakespeare decade to find the spreading

Who will be the other authors?

* Primary britian authors

How late will you go?

* Not specified until now.

How will what you are doing be different than a search on the Google NGram viewer?

* Someone must check this tool please
